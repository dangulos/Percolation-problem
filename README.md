## Diseño General
Se realizó un programa en Python para simular el problema de "La percolación", se necesita instalar las siguientes librerías para su funcionamiento:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

Esto puede hacerse mediante el uso del los comandos:
        <pre><code>pip install pandas
        pip install numpy
        pip install matplotlib
        </code></pre>
Para realizar una simulacion se debe usar el siguiente comando:
<pre><code>python percolation.py n m [-i or --intervals] number of intervals [-a or --attempts] number of attempts
        </code></pre>

Donde n y m corresponden al tamaño de la matriz a usar.

La programa consiste en tres partes, el percolation el cual contiene la lógica general y coordina las actividades, el mazes el cual se encarga de generar la roca como un conjunto de nodos y el depth-first-search que se encarga de buscar un camino en la roca generada.

## Resultados obtenidos

- Haciendo uso de una matriz 50 * 50, con 200 iteraciones y intervalos de 0.02 se obtuvo la siguiente tabla:

## Análisis de resultados

En la mayoría de casos se puede ver que pasado cierto punto la probabilidad tiende a 1 y que el punto en donde se llega a esa tendencia depende del valor de m*n, entre más bajo este, se necesita una probabilidad mayor para encontrar caminos efectivos, esto se puede observar tanto en las gráficas, como en las tablas, según las gráficas obtenidas se puede decir que se asemeja a una distribución normal o gaussiana.
